# Schellings-Model-of-Segregation
Thomas Schelling created an agent-based model that suggested inadvertent behavior might also contribute to segregation. His model of segregation showed that even when individuals (or "agents") didn't mind being surrounded or living by agents of a different race or economic background, they would still choose to segregate themselves from other agents over time! Although the model is quite simple, it provides a fascinating look at how individuals might self-segregate, even when they have no explicit desire to do so.
